				<h1>Coordinating amongst a group can be a major hassle. Anyone who has had the responsibility before will almost certainly agree that balancing each group memberâ€™s individual preferences and availability can quickly overwhelm the organizer. The problem is further complicated by the fact that there are many different decisions that any given group must make. For instance, many groups must constantly find the best time to meet, figure out ways to separate individual responsibilities, prioritize their changing goals, and inform other members of progress. If the size of the group changes over time, keeping everyone on the same page becomes even more difficult. Overall, the time that a group spends solely on coordination detracts from its productivity.</h1>
